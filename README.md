Password Generator for Northwestern Coding Bootcamp

This piece of script prompts the user to enter a length between 8 and 128 characters and then confirm whether or not the password generated will have uppercase, lowercase, and special characters. If the user tries to choose a length outside of the range (less than 8 or greater than 129) they will be unable to move forward.
